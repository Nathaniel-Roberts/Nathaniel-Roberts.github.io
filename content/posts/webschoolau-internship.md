# Reflecting on My Internship Experience at WebSchool.au
## An Opportunity to Grow and Innovate
I am thrilled to share my journey as an intern at WebSchool.au, where I had the incredible opportunity to focus on Ethical Hacking and conducting penetration tests. This internship, facilitated by SETUP International and Macquarie University, has been an invaluable experience, allowing me to apply my academic knowledge in a real-world context and work alongside some of the bright minds in the industry.

## Key Learnings and Experiences
### Penetration Testing in a Live Environment
One of the most significant aspects of this internship was working on penetration testing in a live environment built on APIs. Testing a live system required us to be careful and cautious to avoid disruptions while ensuring comprehensive security assessments. This real-world application of our skills highlighted the importance of precision and responsibility in penetration testing, while sticking closely to the scope of works.

### Mastery of Kali Linux
We also became proficient in Kali Linux, a powerful linux platform specifically designed for cybersecurity tasks. Utilising Kali Linux provided us access to a wide range of tools and resources that significantly enhanced our testing capabilities.

### Utilising Penetration Tools
Our new skills in penetration tools, such as SQLmap and XSStrike, were another major learning point. SQLmap allowed us to automate the detection of SQL injection vulnerabilities, while XSStrike helped us identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities. Mastering these tools provided us with deeper insights into the security landscape and improved our ability to protect web applications.

## Overcoming Challenges and Enhancing Skills
### Team Adaptability and Workload Management
The project presented a challenge when a team member left early on, requiring us to redistribute the workload. This experience taught us how to adapt quickly and manage unexpected changes effectively. We learned the importance of supporting each other and maintaining team cohesion despite setbacks.

### Time Management and Dual Focus
Balancing penetration testing with the production of instructional videos was crucial. This dual focus required us to prioritise tasks effectively and work efficiently to meet our deadlines.

### Effective Communication and Collaboration
Maintaining open lines of communication between our sponsor and the team was another cornerstone of our success. Ensuring that everyone was informed and aligned with the project goals allowed us to collaborate closely with our sponsor, ensuring that our goals were achievable and aligned with their expectations. Regular feedback sessions and collaborative discussions helped us stay on track and deliver valuable outcomes.

### Project Management Techniques
We applied project management techniques, specifically using a Kanban board. This visual tool allowed us to track our tasks, manage our time, and ensure that all team members were aware of our progress and responsibilities. The Kanban board was instrumental in keeping us organised and focused throughout the project.

## Presenting Our Achievements
Our internship concluded with final presentations, where we showcased our experiences and accomplishments. This was a moment of pride for all of us, as it reflected our hard work, creativity, and commitment to our projects. The software development interns also presented their impressive work on the OzOS projects and the Cerebra-Lib AI framework.

## Gratitude and Future Aspirations
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Dmitrii Khovanskii, the team at WebSchool.au, and everyone at SETUP International for their guidance and support. This experience has not only enriched my technical expertise but also ignited a passion for learning and growth in the field of cybersecurity. I am excited about the future and look forward to continuing my journey in this dynamic industry.

## Looking Ahead
This internship has been a pivotal step in my career, providing me with the confidence and skills to tackle new challenges. I am eager to see what the future holds and remain committed to contributing to the field of cybersecurity.

Thank you once again to everyone who made this experience possible. Your support and encouragement have been instrumental in my development, and I am forever grateful for this incredible opportunity.
