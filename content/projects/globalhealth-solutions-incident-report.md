## Identifying Risks, Frameworks and Tools

### Selection and Application of Cybersecurity Framework

In response to the ransomware attack, GlobalHealth Solutions (GHS) needs to adopt a comprehensive cybersecurity framework to manage risks and address vulnerabilities effectively. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is highly suitable for this purpose. Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the NIST CSF is a flexible, risk-based approach that can be customised to meet GHS's specific security needs while ensuring compliance with industry standards.

The NIST framework comprises five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Applying these steps would allow GHS to develop a robust security infrastructure that addresses both current vulnerabilities and future threats.

#### Identify

GHS should identify critical data assets, including EHRs, patient PII, and financial information, and conduct regular risk assessments to uncover vulnerabilities like the FortiGate VPN exploit. Establishing a detailed asset inventory, classifying systems by risk level, and understanding the sensitivity of data to guide protection measures and resource allocation.

#### Protect

GHS needs to implement robust safeguards, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption for data in transit and at rest. Network segmentation, particularly for sensitive systems like EHR databases, should limit lateral movement of attackers. Prioritising regular patch management to address vulnerabilities promptly.

#### Detect

Enhance detection with real-time monitoring using SIEM tools to spot anomalies early, as seen in the October 12, 2023 breach. AI-driven threat detection can flag unusual activities and expedite response. Regularly audit logs and access patterns to catch potential intrusions early and minimise breach impact.

#### Respond

GHS should have a clear incident response plan that includes containment measures, coordination with cybersecurity firms and law enforcement, and regular response drills. Strengthening these protocols will ensure a swift and coordinated reaction to future incidents.

#### Recover

Focus on restoring normal operations with reliable, regularly tested backup systems. Conduct post-incident analyses to improve recovery and resilience, and invest in training programs to foster a strong cybersecurity culture and reduce human error.

### Addressing Vulnerabilities and Risk Management

The ransomware attack primarily exploited the unpatched FortiGate VPN solution. GHS should implement a formal vulnerability management process, including regular network scans, timely patching, and security updates, as recommended by the NIST CSF’s "Protect" function. Adopting a zero-trust architecture, where no user or device is trusted by default, and using multi-layered defenses like intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and data loss prevention (DLP) tools can further mitigate risks.

Additionally, continuous improvement is crucial. GHS should regularly review and update security policies, conduct penetration tests, and perform vulnerability assessments to identify and address weaknesses. By following the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, GHS can better manage risks and enhance its security posture.

## Responding to Cybersecurity Attacks

### Evaluation of GlobalHealth Solutions' Incident Response

GlobalHealth Solutions (GHS) responded promptly to the ransomware attack by isolating infected systems, collaborating with SecureShield to contain the threat, and notifying law enforcement. These actions demonstrate key strengths in their incident response, such as swift breach identification and decisive containment measures. The rapid shutdown of impacted systems helped limit the spread of malware and likely reduced the extent of data exfiltration. GHS also demonstrated sound judgment by engaging third-party cybersecurity experts, showcasing their readiness to seek external assistance in handling a complex ransomware incident. Furthermore, communicating with law enforcement reflected transparency and helped maintain trust with clients and regulatory bodies.

However, several weaknesses in GHS's response emerged. A critical issue was the delayed application of security patches, particularly for the known FortiGate VPN zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-36025), which left the organisation exposed to the attack. Additionally, while systems were eventually isolated, abnormal activity went undetected for hours, indicating gaps in real-time threat detection. This delay heightened the risk of data loss and operational disruption. Another significant shortcoming was the lack of a fully tested incident response plan. While GHS took steps to contain the attack, the absence of a well-documented and rehearsed plan led to confusion and miscommunication among key personnel, resulting in slower recovery times and prolonging the breach’s impact.

### Suggested Improvements Based on Best Practices

To enhance its incident response, GHS should prioritise both preparedness and real-time detection. Investing in advanced tools like a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system and integrating intrusion detection systems (IDS) will improve visibility and early detection of threats, minimising future attack impacts.

GHS should formalise its patch management with automated updates and a structured assessment timeline to address vulnerabilities efficiently, as seen with the FortiGate VPN issue. Developing a detailed incident response plan (IRP) with clear roles and regular training exercises, such as red teaming, will enhance crisis readiness and response effectiveness.

Robust data backup and recovery systems are essential. Implementing offline and geographically dispersed backups and regularly testing their integrity will facilitate swift recovery.
